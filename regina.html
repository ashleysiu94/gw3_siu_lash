        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>Head of the Plastics. Reigning Spring Fling Queen. What can’t Regina George do? Apparent-ly, she can’t keep Aaron Samuels’ attention. She doesn’t seem to be over him, even though they’ve broken up, and we’ve all seen Aaron flirting with new girl, Cady Heron.</p>
        <p>Also, the crown may be falling off Regina’s head. It seems her sidekicks Gretchen Wieners and Karen Smith are starting to follow Cady instead of her. But let’s face it, this is long over-due. Regina has been stabbing her friends in the back for ages. I wouldn’t want to get caught up in a 3-way call attack with her.</p>
        <p>The only thing less cool about Regina is her “cool mom.” Why can’t the woman act her age? She clearly peaked in high school. One can only pray that immaturity is not genetic.</p>
        <p>Rumor has it Regina has been gaining a ton of weight, despite trying to diet. In fact, the Plastics banned her from the lunch table when she wore sweatpants on a Monday. She says sweatpants are all that fit her right now, but rules are rules, and she can’t sit with them. Regina’s new wardrobe must be from Sears, after the sales lady at 135 said they don’t carry clothes in her size. Apparently Regina had put a dress for the Spring Fling on hold, and couldn’t zip it up. What a fatty!</p>
