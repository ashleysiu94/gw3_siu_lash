        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>The new girl at North Shore High School spent the first 12 years of her life in Africa. She was homeschooled, and it shows. Did you see how she dressed at the start of the school year? Plaid, collared shirts on the first day of school should be canceled. The only good thing to come out of Cady joining the Plastics is her new sense of style.</p>
        <p>Cady may have joined Regina George’s clique for now, but she’ll never be the Queen Bee. Her attempt at taking down Regina makes her a wannabe. We all know Cady’s real friends are outcasts – Janis Ian and Damian Leigh.</p>
        <p>Also, this so-called “popular girl” is actually a major nerd. Cady is part of the Mathletes. Ru-mor has it, she’s Ms. Norbury’s favorite student. What a teacher’s pet! Cady dumbed herself down, failing a Calculus test on purpose, to get pretty boy Aaron Samuels. No wonder he didn’t get with Cady immediately after breaking things off with Regina. She’s a nerd and a liar.</p>
